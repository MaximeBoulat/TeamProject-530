## Smart City Energy Consumption Monitoring and Prediction System

This project develops a complete IoT system for monitoring and predicting urban electricity consumption patterns using the Smart Meters in London dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains real-world electricity consumption data collected from over 5,000 residential smart meters across London between November 2011 and February 2014, representing a large-scale IoT deployment as part of the UK Power Networks Low Carbon London project.

**Dataset**: The dataset includes millions of time-stamped energy consumption records with variables such as electricity usage measurements, household identifiers, temporal data, and aggregated daily statistics (mean, min, max, standard deviation, total usage). Supplemental weather and household classification data enable advanced consumption behavior modeling.

**IoT Application**: The system tracks electricity usage trends, predicts future energy demand, and identifies consumption patterns including peak and off-peak periods. Machine learning models generate forecasts and actionable insights for data-driven decision making.

**Target Users**: Utility providers, city energy planners, sustainability teams, and policy makers who can leverage the system for load balancing, energy efficiency planning, and long-term infrastructure development.

**System Components**: The project includes a complete theoretical IoT system design addressing sensors, edge processing, networking protocols, data storage/processing infrastructure, and machine learning insight generation. Implementation features exploratory data analysis, data cleaning/processing pipelines, and at least two machine learning methods including one deep learning model and one time series prediction model.

**Deliverables**: Results are communicated through an interactive Tableau Public dashboard providing status visualizations, historical summaries, and machine learning insights designed for practical smart city energy management applications. 

## Instructions

Add a build/datasets folder at the root of the project and place the acorn_details.csv, daily_dataset.csv and information_households.csv from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london/) inside. 

Then you can run the notebooks and the project straight from VSCode.
